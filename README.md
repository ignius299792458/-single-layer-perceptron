# Objectives

1. To implement and train the `single layer perceptron` using sigmoid activation function to classify the seperable datasets.
2. To adjusts the perceptron weights and bias till it correctly classifies all the inputs or reaches the maximum allowed iterations
3. To visualizes the learning and evolution process of the decision boundry
